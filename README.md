# OkReport

An **Android library** which **allows testers to submit reports without living the app**.

Because not all bugs are easy to catch, because not all bugs end with a clean reported crash on some fancy console as the result of a nice pipeline settled for logging exceptions. That's it, **there is always some wrong behaviour which can not be typified as a bug per se**; and therefore, it requires the **supervision of a human eye** to acknowledge it as a malfunction of the system. **OkReport is the perfect tool for tracking that**.

## Features
* **Write reports organically within the app**, without loosing the context which is precisely the source of the problem and therefore it has to be properly tamed.
* A loosely coupled system which allows to plug in **custom implementations for [TriggerGesture](#trigger_gesture) and [Reporter](#reporter)**
* **Built-in no-op versions** that can be used in release builds in order to avoid bloating production code with pointless dependencies.
* **A minimal-user-friendly UI**


## Setup
Add to top level *gradle.build* file

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add to app module *gradle.build* file
```gradle
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.cookpad:OkReport:core:0.0.5'

	//Post the report on a Slack channel
	debugCompile 'com.github.cookpad:OkReport:slack_reporter:0.0.5'
   	releaseCompile 'com.github.cookpad:OkReport:slack_reporter_no_op:0.0.5'

	//Trigger the report screen when the device is shaken
	debugCompile 'com.github.cookpad:OkReport:shake_gesture:0.0.5'
   	releaseCompile 'com.github.cookpad:OkReport:shake_gesture_no_op:0.0.5'
}
```

## Usage

### Init and confugire OkReport

```kotlin
class OkReportApp : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // Triggers the report screen when the device is shaken.
        val shakeGesture = ShakeGesture(this)

        // Posts the data retrieved from OkReport into a Slack channel.
        val slackReporter = slackReporter()

        // Entry point to start OkReport. Call it just one time per life-time application.
        initOkReport(this, shakeGesture, slackReporter)
    }

    private fun slackReporter() : Reporter {

        // Slack's token required to upload the images to Slack hosts. Go to https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens and create one.
        val legacyToken = ""

        // Webhook's url in which SlackReporter relies to perform the publishing report. Go to https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks and create one.
        val webhookURL = ""

        // Name or id of the channel where report's image should be published. See limitation section for more details.
        val channelImages = "image_noise"

        // Handy information about the device and the build version, such us device model, locale or current version code.
        val deviceSpecs = collectDeviceSpecs(this)

        // False by default, if true, it triggers desktop and push notifications to all team members in the channel where the report has been posted.
        val notifyChannel = true

        return SlackReporter(legacyToken, webhookURL, collectDeviceSpecs(this), channelImages, notifyChannel)
    }
}
```

### <a name="ok_report_workflow"></a> OkReport's workflow

1. #### Go to an app's section, shake the device, explain the issue and describe the step.

![Screenshots](assets/step1A.png) ![Screenshots](assets/step1B.png)

2. #### Add as much steps as required following the previous instruction.

![Screenshots](assets/step2A.png) ![Screenshots](assets/step2B.png)

3. #### If required, highlight some area of the screenshot

![Screenshots](assets/step3A.png) ![Screenshots](assets/step3B.png)

4. #### Submit the report

#### This is how the report looks on Slack's channel.

## Customization

OkReport's sources is composed by several Android modules. This loosely coupled system allows clients to **provide their own implementations when some customization is required**.

### <a name="trigger_gesture"></a> TriggerGesture
The entry point of OkReport is a `TriggerGesture`. By adding `shake_gesture` module, OkReport triggers the report screen when the device is shaken. But **clients can supply their own implementation if other trigger gesture is required.**

If you consider that some gesture may be interesting to add to this lib, please submit a PR as a new separate module with its own no-op version. **`TriggerGesture` is the `interface` that has be implemented to fulfill the contract**:

```kotlin
interface TriggerGesture {
    fun onTrigger(callback: () -> Unit)
}

class CustomTriggerGesture(context: Context) : TriggerGesture {

    override fun onTrigger(callback: () -> Unit) {
        //When the internal event is triggered, make a call to the callback function.
        customListener {
            callback()
        }
    }
}
```

### <a name="reporter"></a> Reporter
OkReport logs reports by delegating this responsibility to a given `Reporter`. By adding `slack_reporter` module, OkReport posts the data retrieved from OkReport into a Slack channel. But **clients can supply their own implementation if other logger mechanism is required.**

If you consider that some Reporter may be interesting to add to this lib, please submit a PR as a new separate module with its own no-op version. **`Reporter` is the `interface` that has be implemented to fulfill the contract**:

```kotlin
interface Reporter {
    fun sendReport(report: Report, reporterCallback: ReporterCallback)
}

interface ReporterCallback {
    fun success(message: String)
    fun error(error: Throwable)
}

class CustomReporter() : Reporter {
    override fun sendReport(report: Report, reporterCallback: ReporterCallback) {
        //Take report's data and send it whatever you want.
        val response = someServer.sendReport(report)

        //And let know OkReport about the result
        if (response.ok) {
            reporterCallback.success("ok")
        } else {
            reporterCallback.error(RuntimeException("ko"))
        }
    }
}
```

## Limitations
* OkReport is **not meant to be used as a way of getting feedback from final users on production environment**, it rather should be conceived as a communication tool to facilitate internal reporting.
* Slack's api presents a limitation for legacy tokens: **it's not possible to show an image on a posted message without been previously shared on a channel's organization**. That's why when you're creating an instance of `SlackReporter` you must to supply the name or id of an already existing channelÂ¡s organization where images will be posted isolatedly.
